What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\nA) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\nB) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket’s maximum lifetime.\nC) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket’s expiration time to the server’s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\nD) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC’s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.", "target": "C", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"acc": 0.0}, "extracted_prediction": "R", "prediction": "ANSWER:", "explanation": null, "metadata": {}, "main_score_name": null}, "sample_id": 2, "group_id": 2, "sample_metadata": {"subject": "computer_security"}}}

Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don’t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2.
